# protocol-analysis-with-machine learning
Here,you can find all the data set and python codes provided in paper Application of Neural Networks in analysis of strong authentication, key freshness, key authentication, Unknown Key Share (UKS) and password guessing attack in authentication and key agreement protocols.

'Our proposed model.py' converts the datasets to the our proposed dataset construction model.In addition, the datasets used through our experimental analysis is shown in UKS branches,Key authentication branch, key freshness branch and Password guessing branches. 
'UKS.txt' contains the datasets developed for analyzing UKS attack. 'key freshness.txt' contains the datasets developed for analyzing key freshness. 'Secresy.txt' contains the datasets developed for analyzing key authentication.  'Password GA.txt' contains the datasets developed for analyzing Password guessing attack.  

Our XGBoost , Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) implementations are shown in 'XGBoost.py','MLP.py' files respectilvly.
